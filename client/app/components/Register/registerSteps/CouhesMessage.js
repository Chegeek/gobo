                        {<h5>TL;DR: This is a MIT research project to study how people filter their social media feeds. We're tracking your use of the site, but will only publish it anonymously and in aggregate. We might follow up with you to hear more about what you think about Gobo. The MIT Institutional Review Board has approved of this study.</h5>}
                        <p>You are asked to participate in a research study conducted by Ethan Zuckerman, Rahul Bhargava (M.S.), Jasmin Rubinovitz (M.S.) and Alexis Hope (M.S.), from the MIT Media Lab at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology (M.I.T.) You were selected as a possible participant in this study because you are interested in online social media platforms. You should read the information below, and ask questions about anything you do not understand, before deciding whether or not to participate.</p>
                        <h3>PARTICIPATION AND WITHDRAWAL</h3>
                        <p>Your participation in this study is completely voluntary and you are free to choose whether to be in it or not. If you choose to be in this study, you may subsequently withdraw from it at any time without penalty or consequences of any kind.  The investigator may withdraw you from this research if circumstances arise which warrant doing so.</p>
                        <h3>PURPOSE OF THE STUDY</h3>
                        <p>This study will assess how you use a new website that lets you control what content, and from whom, you are exposed to from your various social media networks. We will analyze how you choose to filter and prioritize content based on criteria our website offers.</p>
                        <h3>PROCEDURES</h3>
                        <p>If you volunteer to participate in this study, we would ask you to do the following things: Create an account on our website, and authorize our site to pull in posts from your friends and pages you follow on various social media platforms.  Then you will have the opportunity to see a combined list of all the content in one place, and control how it is filtered and prioritized. We ask that you use our website for at least a month, trying various settings for the filters to control what you see.</p>
                        <h3>POTENTIAL RISKS AND DISCOMFORTS</h3>
                        <p>We do not foresee any potential risks or discomforts from this study.  All the content you control will be things you have chosen to follow on other social media websites.</p>
                        <h3>POTENTIAL BENEFITS</h3>
                        <p>We hope this study helps you understand how social media websites create algorithms to control what you see and in which order. This may expose you to a wider set of points of view, perhaps changing your social media habits.</p>
                        <p>At a broader scale, this study may show that social media users want to be in control of how the content they see if selected and filtered.</p>

                        <p>You will not receive any payment for participating in this study.</p>
